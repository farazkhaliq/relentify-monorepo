# 22accounting

The main Relentify SaaS app. Accounting software for UK small businesses.
Next.js 15 app router, Postgres, Stripe Connect, Resend email, TrueLayer open banking.

Container: `22accounting` on port 3022 → accounting.relentify.com
Shared DB: `infra-postgres` → relentify DB, relentify_user
Monorepo: `/opt/relentify-monorepo/apps/22accounting/`
Cron container: none currently — escalation cron runs via `/api/cron/po-escalation` (HTTP, protected by `x-cron-secret`)

---

## Architecture

- **App router** — all pages under `app/dashboard/`, APIs under `app/api/`
- **Feature gating** — `lib/tiers.ts` is the single source of truth. Use `canAccess(tier, feature)` to gate
- **Services** — all DB logic lives in `lib/services/*.service.ts` — never write raw queries in routes
- **Double-entry GL** — every financial transaction posts a balanced journal entry via `postJournalEntry()` in `general_ledger.service.ts`. GL posting is **BLOCKING and ATOMIC** — `createInvoice`, `createBill`, `createCreditNote`, `createExpense`, `approveExpense`, `convertToInvoice`, `approvePurchaseOrder`, `importOpeningBalances`, and `createIntercompanyTransaction` all use `withTransaction()` so a GL failure rolls back the parent record too. Never use try/catch to make GL non-blocking.
- **Email** — Resend via `lib/email.ts`. All `from:` addresses use `invoices@relentify.com` (production domain — do not change back to resend.dev).
- **Auth** — `getAuthUser()` from `src/lib/auth.ts` returns JWT payload (userId, actorId, email, subscriptionPlan?, isAccountantAccess?). Checks `relentify_client_token` first (accountant impersonation), falls through to `relentify_token`. Does NOT include entity_id or tier — call `getActiveEntity(auth.userId)` and `getUserById(auth.userId)` separately in routes.
- **Accountant access** — When `auth.isAccountantAccess === true`, `auth.userId` = client, `auth.actorId` = accountant. `checkPermission()` grants full access. `logAudit()` accepts optional 6th param `actorId` to record who made the change.
- **Import paths** — ALWAYS use `@/src/lib/` (not `@/lib/`). The tsconfig maps `@/` → app root, so `@/lib/` resolves to a non-existent directory.
- **Audit** — `logAudit()` from `src/lib/audit.service.ts` — signature: `logAudit(userId, action, entityType, entityId?, metadata?, actorId?, workspaceEntityId?)`. The `actor_id` and `workspace_entity_id` columns now exist in `audit_log` (migration 025). Previously, every `logAudit` call was silently failing because `actor_id` was missing from the DB.

## Tier System

Defined in `lib/tiers.ts`. Never hardcode tier names in components — always use `canAccess()`.

| Tier | Key features |
|------|-------------|
| invoicing | Invoices, quotes, card payments, chart of accounts |
| sole_trader | + Bills, reports, bank reconciliation, reminders, GL/trial balance, credit notes |
| small_business | + MTD VAT, expenses, mileage, import |
| medium_business | + Custom branding, multi-currency, PO approvals, KPIs |
| corporate | + Multi-entity, intercompany, consolidated reporting, audit log |

---

### ✅ Priority 1 — Bugs (complete)

| # | St | Item |
|---|----|------|
| 5 | ✅ | **Price formatting bug** — 1 qty × 10000 = £100.00. Declared fixed by user; verify in live testing. |
| 9 | ✅ | **Team invite link** — page at `/dashboard/team/accept` + email URL both correct. |
| 8 | ✅ | **Quotes email not delivered** — `from:` changed from resend.dev sandbox to `invoices@relentify.com`. |
| 19 | ✅ | **Connect bank bad request** — TrueLayer scope fixed to `info accounts balance offline_access`. |

---

| # | St | Item |
|---|----|------|
| 11 | ✅ | **Suppliers page** — `/dashboard/suppliers`, full CRUD, `SupplierCombobox` in `@relentify/ui`. |
| 18 | ✅ | **Remove dead nav links** — Pay Bills / E-Banking removed. |

---

### ✅ Priority 3 — Core features + financial integrity + workflows (complete)

| # | St | Item |
|---|----|------|
| 10 | ✅ | Credit notes — list/create/detail/void with GL reversal. |

---

### ✅ Priority 4 — File Attachments (complete)

Receipt/invoice PDF/photo upload against any bill, bank payment, or expense. Migration 020 applied.

**Storage:** `StorageProvider` abstraction — `STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres` (default, bytea) or `r2` (Cloudflare R2).
**Compression:** `sharp` for images (→ WEBP @ q80, max 2000px), Ghostscript for PDFs (`/ebook` 150 DPI). Always stores the smaller of compressed vs original.
**Tier gate:** `small_business` and above (`canAccess(tier, 'capture_bills_receipts')`).

**New files:**
- `database/migrations/020_attachments.sql` — `attachments` + `attachment_data` tables
- `src/lib/storage/index.ts` — StorageProvider interface + factory
- `src/lib/storage/postgres.ts` — bytea storage backend
- `src/lib/storage/r2.ts` — Cloudflare R2 backend (lazy-loaded, optional dep)
- `src/lib/compress-attachment.ts` — image (sharp) + PDF (ghostscript) compression
- `src/lib/attachment.service.ts` — CRUD service
- `app/api/attachments/route.ts` — GET list, POST upload (20MB cap, PDF/JPEG/PNG/WEBP)
- `app/api/attachments/[id]/route.ts` — GET file bytes, DELETE
- `src/components/Attachments.tsx` — shared client component

**Integrated into:** bills detail page, expenses page (per-expense + per-mileage), banking page (per-transaction).

**Env vars:** `STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres` (set in `.env`). For R2: add `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME` and change backend to `r2`.

**Dockerfile:** `apk add --no-cache ghostscript` in runner stage.
**next.config.js:** `serverExternalPackages: ['@aws-sdk/client-s3', '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner']`.

---

### ✅ Priority 5 — UI Polish (complete)

Several pages haven't been updated to match the dark-mode `@relentify/ui` style. Do all at once to avoid rework.

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 1 | ✅ **Dashboard rebuild** — net position hero, profit YTD vs prior year, 30-day forecast, alerts strip. Bank balance line chart (daily, 6 months), cashflow bar chart (11 months + MTD + 30-day forecast bar), forecast drill-down modal. |
| 2 | ✅ **New invoice page** — removed redundant nav; all text-white → theme vars; border-white → theme-border. |
| 3 | ✅ **New invoice — inline project creation** — `+New` button opens modal; tier-gated via `canAccess(tier, 'project_tracking')`; auto-selects new project on create. |
| 4 | ✅ **Date pickers** — `DatePicker` component created in `@relentify/ui`; replaced all 25 native `<input type="date">` across 18 files. Uses Popover+Calendar; ISO string bridge appends `T00:00:00` to avoid UTC off-by-one. |
| 6 | ✅ **New quote page** — same fixes as invoice page; removed redundant nav, dark mode consistent. |
| 7 | ✅ **Team invite page** — text-white → theme vars; border-white → theme-border; card bg uses theme vars. |

---

### ✅ Priority 6 — Production Hardening

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 46 | ✅ **API rate limiting** — in-process IP throttle in `middleware.ts`. 60 req/min general, 5/min for invoice send, 10/min for attachments. 66-minute ban on breach. Matcher expanded to `/api/:path*`. OAuth callbacks and cron routes added to PUBLIC_PATHS. |
| 42 | ✅ **GL silent failure visibility** — `Sentry.captureException()` added to all GL catch blocks across `invoice.service.ts`, `bill.service.ts`, `credit_note.service.ts`, `expense.service.ts`, `expense_approval.service.ts`. Each tagged with `gl_operation`. |
| 48 | ✅ **Company settings completeness** — migration 021 adds `registered_address`, `bank_account_name`, `sort_code`, `account_number` to `users` table. `/api/user/route.ts` and `/api/user/update/route.ts` updated. SettingsForm shows Registered Address + Bank Details for Remittances sections. |

---

### 🔴 Priority 7 — Advanced / Post-Launch

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 28 | ✅ **Accountant signup + multi-client** — free accountant tier, `accountant_clients` table, both-direction invite (email + accept link), client portal at `/dashboard/accountant`, AccountantBanner when inside client account, 10% referral commission via `accountant_referral_earnings` (36 months, `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook), bank details for manual payouts. Migration 022. |
| 38 | **Global accountant dashboard** — already covered by #28 (health stats: overdue invoices, unmatched transactions, missing receipts shown per client in portal). |
| 36 | ✅ **Comments/threads on transactions** — `transaction_comments` table (migration 023), `comment.service.ts`, API routes at `/api/comments`, shared `<Comments>` component. Wired into bills, invoices, expenses, banking, journals. Central `/dashboard/conversations` page. Email notification on first unread (unread-based, no delays). Unlimited thread nesting via `parent_id`. |
| 37 | ✅ **Bookkeeping health score** — 4 checks (reconciliation, missing receipts, overdue invoices, VAT compliance), scored out of 100. `/dashboard/reports/health`, API at `/api/reports/health`. |
| 39 | ✅ **Flexible custom reports** — custom date ranges, drill-downs, column picker, export. `/dashboard/reports/custom`, API at `/api/reports/custom`. |

---

### ✅ COMPLETED

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 8 | Quotes — email fixed. `from:` changed from `resend.dev` sandbox to `invoices@relentify.com`. |

| 45 | Sentry error monitoring — `@sentry/nextjs` v8, DSN in `.env`, `instrumentation.ts`, `sentry.client.config.ts`, `global-error.tsx`. |
| 27 | Import — `/dashboard/import`, supports customers/suppliers/invoices/bills/expenses. |
| 25 | VAT returns — page was already fully built (HMRC MTD flow, 9-box calc, submit). Fixed entity_id scoping, standard VAT invoice scope (sent+paid+overdue), bills use `COALESCE(invoice_date, due_date)`. |
| 29 | Lock periods — `locked_through_date` on entities, `period_lock_overrides` for accountant bypass. Migration 017. `period_lock.service.ts`. Settings UI Period Locks tab with lock/unlock and override management. |

## Database Notes

- All user data is scoped by `user_id` — always filter by it
- `entity_id` scopes data within a workspace (multi-entity support)
- Key tables: `users`, `entities`, `invoices`, `invoice_items`, `bills`, `expenses`, `mileage_claims`, `customers`, `suppliers`, `credit_notes`, `credit_note_items`, `bank_connections`, `bank_transactions`, `audit_logs`, `projects`, `intercompany_transactions`, `purchase_orders`, `po_items`, `po_settings`, `po_approver_mappings`, `expense_approval_settings`, `chart_of_accounts`, `journal_entries`, `journal_lines`, `attachments`, `attachment_data`
- `chart_of_accounts` — scoped by `entity_id`. System accounts (`is_system=TRUE`) cannot be deactivated.
- `journal_entries` + `journal_lines` — every financial event posts here. `source_type` + `source_id` link back to the originating record.
- `credit_notes` — linked to `invoices.id` (optional) and `customers.id` (optional). Sequence: `credit_note_number_seq`.

### New services added by this workstream

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/idempotency.service.ts` | `checkIdempotencyKey`, `storeIdempotencyKey`, `cleanExpiredKeys` — 24h TTL, entity-scoped |
| `src/lib/vat.service.ts` | Explicit UK VAT functions: `calcStandardRated`, `calcZeroRated`, `calcExempt`, `calcReverseCharge`, `calcPartialExemption`, `vatPeriodDate` |
| `src/lib/cron-monitor.service.ts` | `startCronRun(jobName)`, `finishCronRun(runId, status, count?, error?)` — logs to `cron_runs`, Telegram alert on failure |

### Key GL rules added

- `postJournalEntry` enforces period lock internally (cannot be bypassed)
- Invoice journal entries must have `isControlAR: true` on the Debtors line
- Bill journal entries must have `isControlAP: true` on the Creditors line
- All entries written with `status='posted'` and `is_locked=TRUE`
- `workspace_members.role` — `admin | accountant | staff` (default `staff`). Manual journals require `admin` or `accountant`.
